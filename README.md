## Overview

This project implements an interactive **UK Energy & Sustainability Dashboard** built using **Streamlit**.  
It integrates electricity demand, generation, carbon intensity, and weather-related data to provide
an exploratory and analytical view of the UK energy system.

The dashboard is designed to:
- Enable interactive exploration of UK energy time-series data
- Communicate sustainability insights using effective visualisation
- Demonstrate good software engineering practice, including modular design,
  reproducibility, and version control
